15/07/2021: The presence of mixtures is now checked in the SMILES in addition to the chek already made on the Name. SMILES with asterisk (*) characters are now flagged as "Mixtures" under the "Warning (SMILES)" field. This field now includes also Warnings for unusual elements and inorganics. Chemicals having any SMILES warning are eliminated. The "polymer*" search term for identify polymers from Names has been changed to "poly*"
31/01/2019: Fixed a problem when creating a new separate output after manual check. Minor modifications to the user's guide.
01/02/2019: Fixed an error occurring when no chemicals go to the automated check on pubchem and ChemID.
08/02/2018: Fixed an error occurring when no chemicals go to the "Automated Check"
26/03/2018: Fixed an error occuring during the calculation of molecular weight for SMILES including asterisk (*). Now MW is set to zero.
03/07/2019: Added Zinc to metals list for identifying organometallic compounds. Thanks to DocMinus for reporting the issue.
03/07/2019: Modified the criterion to separate main molecules and counterions. Now the fragment with the higher number of atoms is recognized as the main molecule, not the one with the highest MW.
03/07/2017: Added to the repository a reduced version of the workflow that accept SMILES as input and adress only the curation part. This workflow can be used if the user already has a list of SMILES.
